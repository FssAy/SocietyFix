# Society Fix
This repository is dedicated for a "Shadows Of Doubt" mod called "Society Fix".

## About
To read about the mod features, details and installation check the plugin's [**README**](https://github.com/FssAy/SocietyFix/blob/master/meta/README.md).

The main point of the mod is to remove any sexual deviations from the game to make it less political and more enjoyable.
Especially when investigating a case with confusing clues related to the NPC's gender and apperance.
